Simple python based console application to resize images

If you're anything like me, you've probably felt the frustration of uploading images to forms, only to be met with errors about file size limits - too big, too small, never just right. This tool aims to make that a thing of the past.

Simply choose the image you want to resize, set your target file size, pick a save path and filename, and you're done. No more guesswork, no more trial and error.

Required Libraries -
  1. os
  2. opencv
  3. tkinter

Note: Python and the required libraries need to be pre-installed. Originally written only for reading and writing to jpeg/png formats
