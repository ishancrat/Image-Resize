Simple python based console application to resize images

If you're like me, and have always had a passionate hatred for filling forms, mostly due to the images required to be uploaded not meeting the recipient's minimum / maximum size criteria, 
then this might be for you. Choose the image you want to upscale or downscale, choose the save path and name, enter target size and you're done

Required Libraries -
  1. os
  2. opencv
  3. tkinter

Note: Python and the required libraries need to be pre-installed. Originally written only for reading and writing to jpeg/png formats
